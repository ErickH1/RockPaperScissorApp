# RockPaperScissorApp
CSC 198 Senior Design Rock Paper Scissor App

•Collaborated in a team of four to develop a mobile app and a functional 3D-printed hand enabling users to play games independently, customized for the popular game "Rock, Paper, Scissors.
• Took lead in developing the Reactive Native mobile application by learning applications of React Native, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. App allows users to control the robot, initiate games, and view game outcomes. The app communicates with the robot and cam module via WIFI.
• Helped engineer the InMoov 3D printed hand, programmed in Arduino C, and controlled via an ESP32. The hand's movements were controlled by servo motors and fishing wire to simulate human hands.
• Utilized an ESP32 cam module to read user input. Cam module and image detection was programmed using Python, MediaPipe, TensorFlow, and OpenCV. The algorithm processes images captured by the cam module to identify whether the user has displayed a rock, paper, or scissors gesture.
• Took additional lead in integration between the three main components (App, Hand, Cam) through setting up a node.js server.

• Presented in front of my peers, industry professionals and academic professionals allowing us to win 2nd place among my senior class.
